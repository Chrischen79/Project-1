# Project-1 for Data Scientist Advanced course
## Libraries
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. lazypredict
6. shap
7. sklearn
## Motivation for the project
This project builds a machine learning model to predict listing price using the Airbnb Boston data and is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Project 1 of DS course.
## Files description
1. Figs 1-9: Figures used in article "Do a machine learning model before you book on Airbnb" https://schen162.medium.com/do-a-machine-learning-model-before-you-book-on-airbnb-26df91f08182
2. Project1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file including codes.
3. listings.csv: Airbnb Boston data.
## Summary of the results
The results show that it is possible to build a machine learning model to predict the listing price of properties. We expect the prediction error is ~$47.2. The model shows that the predicted price is much lower than the listing price for the expensive properties (>$423).
## CRISP-DM
1. Business understanding - To build a model to predict listing price in Boston. There are several other questions to be answered. See the blog.
2. Data understanding - Airbnb Boston data
3. Data preparation - see the blog and jupyter file
4. Modeling - Random forest
5. Evaluation - see the blog and jupyter file
6. Deployment - predict listing price of properties in Boston - see the blog and jupyter file
